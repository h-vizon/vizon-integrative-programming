# NEURON: Lava Series – Future Pickleball Concept

## 🔹 Project Title

NEURON: Lava Series Landing Page

## 🔹 Description

This project presents a futuristic conceptual landing page for **NEURON**, a high-tech pickleball brand. It highlights the **Lava Series**, a paddle collection inspired by the power and intensity of volcanic energy.

The page is designed for tech-savvy athletes who appreciate both performance and visual design. It functions as a pre-launch showcase, using immersive visuals and storytelling to communicate the brand’s innovation, energy, and premium feel.

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Radial Gradients, Animations)
- **Google Fonts** (Orbitron & Rajdhani)
- **GitHub & GitHub Pages** (Version Control & Hosting)

## 🔹 Features

1. **Immersive Lava UI:** A custom gradient background and a futuristic hero section with soft glowing details.
2. **Floating 3D Animations:** The main paddle gently floats using smooth CSS animations.
3. **Responsive Product Grid:** A clean, modern grid layout that adapts well to both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🔹 AI Assistance Disclosure (Required)

**Did you use AI tools?** Yes

**Tools Used:** ChatGPT (OpenAI) & Google Gemini

**How they were used:**

- I used ChatGPT to generate the concept art for the lava-themed paddles and the background pickleball elements.
- I used Google Gemini to assist with structuring the semantic HTML and resolving specific CSS challenges, such as properly centering the navigation bar and creating the glowing “magma” text effects.
- All code was reviewed, tested, and customized by me to fit the specific project requirements.

## 🔹 Learning Reflection

From this activity, I learned how to use absolute positioning to build more complex interface elements, such as the power meters, within a relative container. The most challenging part was controlling the `z-index` layers so the floating paddle appeared above the glowing interface elements without covering the text. I addressed this by reorganizing the HTML structure, which allowed the layers to display correctly.
