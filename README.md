## 🔹 NEURON: Lava Series – Future Pickleball Concept

## 🔹 Description

This project presents a futuristic conceptual landing page for **NEURON**, a high-tech pickleball brand. It highlights the **Lava Series**, a paddle collection inspired by the power and intensity of volcanic energy.

The page is designed for tech-savvy athletes who appreciate both performance and visual design. It functions as a pre-launch showcase, using immersive visuals and storytelling to communicate the brand’s innovation, energy, and premium feel.

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Radial Gradients, Animations)
- **Google Fonts** (Orbitron & Rajdhani)
- **GitHub & GitHub Pages** (Version Control & Hosting)

## 🔹 Features

1. A custom gradient background and a futuristic hero section with soft glowing details.
2. The main paddle gently floats using smooth CSS animations.
3. A clean, modern grid layout that adapts well to both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🔹 AI Assistance Disclosure

**Did you use AI tools?** Yes

**Tools Used:** ChatGPT (OpenAI) & Google Gemini

**How they were used:**

- I used ChatGPT to generate the concept art for the lava-themed paddles and the background pickleball elements.
- I used Google Gemini to assist with structuring the semantic HTML and resolving specific CSS challenges, such as properly centering the navigation bar and creating the glowing “magma” text effects.
- All code was reviewed, tested, and customized by me to fit the specific project requirements.

## 🔹 Learning Reflection

From this activity, I learned how to use absolute positioning to build more complex interface elements, such as the power meters, within a relative container. The most challenging part was controlling the `z-index` layers so the floating paddle appeared above the glowing interface elements without covering the text. I addressed this by reorganizing the HTML structure, which allowed the layers to display correctly.

# Did you use AI tools? (Yes)

# AI Tools Used: ChatGPT & Google Gemini

# How they were used:

I used ChatGPT to help refine README documentation and layout ideas for the authentication pages.
I used Google Gemini to assist with HTML structure and CSS styling consistency.
All code was reviewed, tested, and customized by me.

# 🔹 Learning Reflection

This activity helped me understand how to create and link multiple pages while maintaining a consistent design. The most challenging part was organizing the form layout and navigation structure. I also learned how user flow impacts the overall usability of a website.
