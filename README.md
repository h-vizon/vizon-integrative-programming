## 🔹 NEURON: Lava Series – Future Pickleball Concept

## 🔹 Description

This project presents a futuristic conceptual landing page for **NEURON**, a high-tech pickleball brand. It highlights the **Lava Series**, a paddle collection inspired by the power and intensity of volcanic energy.

The page is designed for tech-savvy athletes who appreciate both performance and visual design. It functions as a pre-launch showcase, using immersive visuals and storytelling to communicate the brand’s innovation, energy, and premium feel.

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Radial Gradients, Animations)
- **Google Fonts** (Orbitron & Rajdhani)
- **GitHub & GitHub Pages** (Version Control & Hosting)

## 🔹 Features

1. A custom gradient background and a futuristic hero section with soft glowing details.
2. The main paddle gently floats using smooth CSS animations.
3. A clean, modern grid layout that adapts well to both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🔹 Learning Reflection

From this activity, I learned how to use absolute positioning to build more complex interface elements, such as the power meters, within a relative container. The most challenging part was controlling the `z-index` layers so the floating paddle appeared above the glowing interface elements without covering the text. I addressed this by reorganizing the HTML structure, which allowed the layers to display correctly.
